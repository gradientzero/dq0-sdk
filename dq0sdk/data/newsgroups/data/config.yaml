demo parameters:
  # seed for random number generator (reproducibility of experiments).
  seed: 1
  # enable verbose mode: "True", "False".
  # verbose: True


target-model parameters:
  # target model to be used (case insensitive):
  # "GaussianNB"
  # "MultinomialNB"
  # "MLNN"
  target_model_type: MultinomialNB


robustness-test parameters:
  # precision threshold for the class "is_training_instance" when running the
  # membership-inference attack'. Set to 1.0 for no threshold.
  precision_threshold: 1.0
  # recall threshold for the class "is_training_instance" when running the
  # membership-inference attack'. Set to 1.0 for no threshold.
  recall_threshold: 1.0
  # if enabled, the testing of target-model robustness to privacy attacks
  # stops as soon as an attack is successful. Otherwise the remaining planned
  # attacks are run anyway
  stop_at_first_privacy_breach: True


Differential-privacy parameters:
  # privacy budget. The lower, the lower the privacy leakage, but the lower
  # the model utility, too.

  # WARNING: do not use scientific notation in a Yaml file!
  #
  # Set to empty list [] to skip DP-version run
