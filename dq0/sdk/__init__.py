description = 'DQ0 is a platform for secure data storage and processing. It provides tools to perform machine learning methods on data that contain sensitive information and therefore cannot be easily released to external data science teams. DQ0 brings the calculation to the data. Models developed by data scientists can be trained on sensitive data with DQ0 in the secure data enclave. This guide describes how data scientists can start developing models using the DQ0 platform.'  # noqa: E501
